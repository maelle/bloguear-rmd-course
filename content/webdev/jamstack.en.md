[JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) (JavaScript, APIs, Markup) is a way to build website created & promoted by the company Netlify. 
From what I understand all two things shown in this course are more or less JAMStack.

You might find [jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org) and [jamstack.wtf](https://jamstack.wtf/) interesting for your own learning or for better interacting with web developers you might hire.
