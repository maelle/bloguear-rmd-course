- install the remotes package, `install.packages("remotes)`

- install the hugodown package, `remotes::install_github("r-lib/hugodown")`

- `hugodown::hugo_install('0.66.0')`

- `hugodown::create_site_academic()`. Be happy to see everything happening automatically :sparkles:

- `hugodown::hugo_start(render_to_disk = TRUE)`, open localhost in the browser.

- Change site title and [theme](https://wowchemy.com/docs/customization/) in config/_default/params.toml. Yes a theme for a theme!

- Mention [academic docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/), all the things one can change.

- `hugodown::use_post("post/new-rmd-post")`, knit, see post.

- say there will probably be other themes later. show [Hugo theme gallery](https://themes.gohugo.io/) and how I would choose themes.

- `usethis::use_github()`, `hugodown::use_netlify_toml()`, go to Netlify interface.

- add URL to config
